# TL;DR

_SSWMUI_ (Super Simple WireMock User Interface) is an ASP.NET Razor Page
making use of [WireMock.NET](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net),
providing the possibility to create, start,
stop and configure web api proxy instances.
In its current state it is super limited in its functionality but will grow continuously.
